# My API Development Cookbook

This project is a personal cookbook and a living documentation of my best practices for building modern, robust, and scalable APIs. It's a collection of practical choices, architectural patterns, and code snippets that I use in my projects. Consider it my personal "playground" to showcase and document my "art de coder".

The main purpose is not to be cloned as a whole, but to serve as a reference and a source of inspiration. You are encouraged to read the code, understand the choices behind it, and copy any part that you find useful for your own projects. This allows others (and myself) to get an idea of how I organize my coding practices.

## Guiding Principles

This project documents a specific way of work, guided by the following principles:

*   **Clean Code:** Writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
*   **Solid Architecture:** A structure that is scalable and easy to evolve.
*   **Testability:** Code that is easy to test at different levels (unit, integration).
*   **Developer Experience:** A workflow that is enjoyable and productive.

## How to use this project

Instead of cloning this repository to start a new project, consider it as a library of ideas. Browse the `app`, `database` and `tests` directories to see concrete implementations. Each feature or component is designed to be as self-contained as possible, so it can be easily understood and adapted.

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal project, feedback and discussions are always welcome. If you have suggestions or questions, feel free to open an issue.
